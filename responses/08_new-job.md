# New Job

Great, if you look at the logs now, you'll notice that multiple builds will exist: 4 build to be exact! That's because for each of the 2 operating systems we're running tests against 2 versions so: 2 OS :heavy_multiplication_x: 2 Node.js versions = 4 builds.

Our custom workflow now accounts for:
- :white_check_mark: **test against multiple targets** so that we know if our supported operating systems and Node.js versions are working

## Step 9: Use multiple jobs

<img alt="icon of gears indicating relationship between multiple jobs" align="left" width="100" height="100" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6351798/88592093-aab5f500-d01a-11ea-8631-b2200684e7e0.png">

Let's now try to create a dedicated test job and satisfy the second item in our custom workflow checklist. 

This will allow us to separate the build and test functions of our workflow into more than one job that will run when our workflow is triggered.

### Activity: Edit your workflow file to separate build and test jobs

1. Edit [your workflow file]({{ fileUrl }})
2. Create a new job called "test" as follows (we'll use ellipses `...` to only show the parts of the workflow we're interested in, but you should not copy the ellipses directly):
    ```yaml
    name: Node CI

    on: [push]

    jobs:
      build:
        ...
      test:
        ...
    ```  
3. In the `build` job, include the following portions of your existing workflow:
    ```yaml
    build:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - name: npm install and build webpack
          run: |
            npm install
            npm run build
    ```
4. In the newly created `test` job, include the following portions of your existing workflow:
    ```yaml
    test:
      runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
      strategy:
        matrix:
          os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-2016]
          node-version: [12.x, 14.x]
      steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Use Node.js {% raw %}${{ matrix.node-version }}{% endraw %}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: {% raw %}${{ matrix.node-version }}{% endraw %}
      - name: npm install, and test
        run: |
          npm install
          npm test
        env:
          CI: true
    ```

```yaml
name: Node CI

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: npm install and build webpack
        run: |
          npm install
          npm run build

  test:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-2016]
        node-version: [12.x, 14.x]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Use Node.js {% raw %}${{ matrix.node-version }}{% endraw %}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: {% raw %}${{ matrix.node-version }}{% endraw %}
    - name: npm install, and test
      run: |
        npm install
        npm test
      env:
        CI: true
```
</details>

When you commit to this branch, the workflow should run again. I'll respond when it is finished running.

When a GitHub Actions workflow is running, you should see some checks in progress, like the screenshot below.

![checks in progress in a merge box](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16547949/66080348-ecc5f580-e533-11e9-909e-c213b08790eb.png)

If the checks don't appear or if the checks are stuck in progress, there's a few things you can do to try and trigger them:

- Refresh the page, it's possible the workflow ran and the page just hasn't been updated with that change
- Try making a commit on this branch. Our workflow is triggered with a `push` event, and committing to this branch will result in a new `push`
- Edit the workflow file on GitHub and ensure there are no red lines indicating a syntax problem
