  # 1. Bot creates [Tic tac toe game](https://github.com/githubtraining/actions-template) for the learner, protects master branch
  # 1. Bot opens a bug report explaining the app is broken, asks learner to figure out what's wrong by adding some testing.

steps:

  # Step 1
  # 1. Learner opens a PR with a new workflow by using the [templated workflow for Node](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/blob/master/ci/nodejs.yml)
  # 1. Bot leaves line-specific comments explaining the pieces that were just added from the templated workflow.

We'll tackle some of the changes to the existing workflow file first, open a PR to target different Node versions.

  # 1. Learner commits the `runs-on` and chooses an environment
  # 1. Bot asks learner to create a step for approval automation, using the [`pullreminders/label-when-approved-action` action](https://github.com/pullreminders/label-when-approved-action)
  # 1. Bot removes branch protections
  # 1. Bot points out that branch protections aren't currently in place, asks learner to set branch protections, and approve the PR

  # 1. Action runs and applies a label
  # 1. Bot checks that branch protections are in place, asks the learner to fix it if not. Learner may have to re-approve.
  # 1. Bot comments that this action can be used to automatically deploy changes.
  # 1. Bot merges PR.
  # 1. Bot turns on pages build, drops link in the PR, explains to the learner the value on a workflow that enforces team behaviors.
